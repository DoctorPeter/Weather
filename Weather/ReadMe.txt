The program fetches weather forecasts for tomorrow from five sources, which provide free weather API and transmit data in JSON format. The information is displayed to the user separately for each source, as well as an averaged forecast. If the user wishes, they can obtain the resulting data in JSON and/or XML formats.

The program utilizes the following weather forecast sources:

http://free.worldweatheronline.com
http://open-weather.ru
http://pogoda.bilets.org
http://www.wunderground.com
http://www.google.com
Only the first one works properly. The others work with difficulty.
Finding a good free source of weather information that transmits data in JSON format is not easy at all.
If you know of other sources, you can easily insert them into the program.
